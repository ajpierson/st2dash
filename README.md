# st2dash
This is not code I have written.  I believe the code was originally written by Tami. Tami's post can be found at http://www.drohnen-forum.de/index.php/Thread/12303-ST2Dash-der-Flightlog-Konverter-f%C3%BCr-die-ST10-Q500/ but it's all in German.

I got this code from http://yuneec-forum.com/threads/st2dash-convert-st10-flight-log-to-dashware.511/ which is an English conversion by Neal Conrardy

I don't mean to present this code as my own, but thought it might be good to have the code is a public repository for others to enjoy.
